  "introduction": "The myth of Zeus’ abduction of Ganymede is a tale of beauty, desire, and divine favor in Greek mythology. Ganymede, a mortal prince of Troy, was renowned for his extraordinary beauty, which captivated Zeus. In the form of an eagle, Zeus carried Ganymede to Mount Olympus, where he granted him immortality and made him the cupbearer of the gods. This myth has been interpreted in various ways, including as an origin story for the constellation Aquarius and as a reflection of ancient Greek customs regarding mentorship and relationships between men.",
  "mythicHistory": "<p>Ganymede was the son of Tros, the legendary king of Troy, and was said to be the most beautiful mortal of his time. One day, while tending to his father’s flocks on Mount Ida, Ganymede was spotted by Zeus, who was struck by his radiance. Unable to resist, Zeus transformed into a majestic eagle and swooped down from the heavens, seizing the boy in his powerful talons and carrying him away to Olympus.</p>\n\n<p>Upon arriving on Mount Olympus, Ganymede was granted eternal youth and immortality, serving as the cupbearer of the gods, a prestigious role previously held by Hebe, the goddess of youth. This act caused some tension among the gods, particularly Hera, who resented Ganymede’s presence. Despite this, Zeus showered Ganymede with divine favor and even compensated King Tros by gifting him a team of immortal horses or, in some versions, a golden vine as a token of goodwill.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, Ganymede’s myth became closely associated with the constellation Aquarius, symbolizing his eternal role as the divine water-bearer. His story was later interpreted through various cultural lenses, sometimes as an example of divine love and other times as a metaphor for the relationship between gods and mortals. Regardless of interpretation, Ganymede’s abduction remains one of the most enduring and enigmatic myths of Greek mythology.</p>",
