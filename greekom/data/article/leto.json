  "introduction": "Leto is a Titaness and the mother of the twin gods Apollo and Artemis. She is primarily known for her perseverance and motherhood, enduring great hardships to give birth to her children. As the daughter of the Titans Coeus and Phoebe, Leto was revered for her gentleness and grace. Though not one of the twelve Olympians, she was highly respected among the gods, especially as the mother of two of the most powerful deities.",
  "mythicHistory": "<p>Leto’s most famous myth revolves around her struggle to find a place to give birth to her children. After becoming pregnant with Zeus' children, she faced the wrath of Hera, who was furious over Zeus’ infidelity. Hera forbade any land from offering Leto refuge, causing her to wander across the world in search of a safe haven. Eventually, the floating island of Delos, which was not attached to the earth, offered her sanctuary. There, she gave birth to Artemis and, with Artemis' help, later delivered Apollo.</p>\n\n<p>Despite her trials, Leto was a revered figure in Greek mythology, embodying maternal devotion and resilience. She played a protective role over her children and was worshipped in many regions, particularly in Delos and Anatolia, where grand temples were built in her honor. She was often depicted alongside Apollo and Artemis, emphasizing her role as their mother.</p>\n\n<p>One of the myths associated with Leto involves the Lycian peasants, who refused to allow her to drink from their water source. In response, she transformed them into frogs as punishment. This tale highlights her divine power and the reverence she commanded, despite her typically gentle and composed nature.</p>\n\n<p>Though she does not feature prominently in many myths beyond her motherhood, Leto was deeply respected among the gods and mortals alike. Her story reflects the enduring strength of a mother who, despite all obstacles, ensures the safety and success of her children.</p>",
