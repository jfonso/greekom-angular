  "introduction": "The Iliad, an epic poem attributed to Homer, recounts the dramatic events of the Trojan War, focusing on the conflict between the Greek hero Achilles and the Trojan prince Hector. Set during the final year of the decade-long war, the poem explores themes of honor, wrath, fate, and the interference of the gods in mortal affairs. With vivid battle scenes, heroic duels, and divine interventions, The Iliad remains one of the most influential works of ancient Greek literature, shaping the Western understanding of heroism and tragedy.",
  "mythicHistory": "<p>The Trojan War began when Paris, prince of Troy, abducted Helen, the wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta. Enraged, Menelaus and his brother Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae, assembled a vast Greek army and sailed to Troy to reclaim Helen. The Greeks, led by legendary warriors such as Achilles, Odysseus, and Ajax, laid siege to the city for ten years, battling the Trojan forces commanded by Hector and supported by King Priam. The gods of Olympus played an active role, with Athena, Hera, and Poseidon favoring the Greeks, while Apollo, Aphrodite, and Ares aided the Trojans.</p>\n\n<p>The central conflict of The Iliad arises when Agamemnon, the Greek commander, seizes Achilles’ war prize, the maiden Briseis. Furious, Achilles withdraws from battle, refusing to fight for the Greeks. His absence allows the Trojans to gain the upper hand, culminating in Hector’s assault on the Greek ships. Desperate, Agamemnon attempts to reconcile with Achilles, but it is only after the death of his beloved friend Patroclus—killed by Hector—that Achilles returns to the battlefield, consumed by vengeance.</p>\n\n<p>Achilles reenters the war with divine armor forged by Hephaestus and slaughters countless Trojans before confronting Hector outside the walls of Troy. In a climactic duel, Achilles slays Hector and drags his body behind his chariot in an act of brutal retribution. However, in a moment of compassion, he later returns Hector’s body to King Priam for a proper burial. The poem ends with Hector’s funeral, foreshadowing the eventual fall of Troy and the tragic fates of many of its heroes.</p>",
