  "introduction": "Hades, also known as the Underworld, is the realm of the dead in Greek mythology, ruled by the god Hades. It is a vast, shadowy domain where souls reside after death, separated from the land of the living by the rivers Styx and Acheron. Though often depicted as a gloomy place, it contains different regions, including the paradise-like Elysium for heroes and the torturous Tartarus for the wicked.",
  "mythicHistory": "<p>According to Greek mythology, Hades was one of the three realms of the cosmos, divided among Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades after the Titanomachy. Hades was granted dominion over the underworld, where he presided over the dead but did not judge themâ€”this role was assigned to figures like Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Aeacus.</p>\n\n<p>The underworld was believed to be accessible through various caverns and rivers, with Charon ferrying souls across the river Styx if they had a proper burial. Cerberus, the three-headed hound, guarded its entrance to prevent the dead from escaping. The concept of Hades evolved over time, with later myths incorporating ideas of moral judgment and an afterlife of reward or punishment.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, Greek beliefs about the afterlife were influenced by Orphic and Platonic traditions, which introduced notions of reincarnation and spiritual purification. Some souls, after a cycle of rebirths and trials, could eventually escape the underworld and attain a higher existence.</p>",
