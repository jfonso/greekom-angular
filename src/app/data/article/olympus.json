  "introduction": "Mount Olympus is the mythical home of the Olympian gods in Greek mythology, often depicted as a grand, cloud-covered palace where the gods ruled over the world. It was considered the highest and most sacred mountain in Greece, inaccessible to mortals except in rare instances. As the divine seat of power, Olympus was the center of mythological governance and divine feasts.",
  "mythicHistory": "<p>According to Greek mythology, after the Titanomachy—the great war between the Titans and the Olympians—Zeus and his siblings defeated Cronus and the older gods, establishing their rule from Mount Olympus. This victory marked the beginning of the Olympian era, with Zeus as the supreme ruler.</p>\n\n<p>Olympus was envisioned as a paradise above the mortal world, where the gods lived in perfect harmony (though often engaging in conflicts among themselves). The palace of the gods, built by Hephaestus, contained individual residences for each deity, as well as the throne room where Zeus presided over divine councils.</p>\n\n<p>Despite being a realm of divine power, Olympus was not entirely isolated from mortal affairs. The gods frequently intervened in human matters, taking sides in wars, bestowing blessings, and punishing transgressions. Though mortals could not reside there, exceptional heroes such as Heracles were sometimes granted entry after achieving great deeds.</p>",
