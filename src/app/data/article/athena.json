  "introduction": "Athena is the Greek goddess of wisdom, warfare, and strategy, as well as crafts and civilization. She is known for her intelligence, fairness, and military prowess, often depicted wearing armor and carrying a shield adorned with the head of Medusa. As the daughter of Zeus, she was uniquely born fully grown and armored from his forehead, symbolizing her divine knowledge and strength. Athena played a crucial role in many Greek myths, acting as a protector of heroes and a patroness of Athens, the city named in her honor.",
  "mythicHistory": "<p>Athenaâ€™s birth is one of the most famous myths in Greek mythology. According to legend, Zeus swallowed his first wife, Metis, after learning that she was destined to bear a child who would surpass him in wisdom and power. Later, Zeus suffered an unbearable headache, prompting Hephaestus (or, in some versions, Prometheus) to split his head open with an axe. From within, Athena emerged, fully grown and clad in armor, ready to take her place among the Olympian gods.</p>\n\n<p>Athena was a key figure in numerous myths, known for her strategic mind and just nature. Unlike Ares, the god of war who represented brute force and chaos, Athena embodied disciplined warfare and wisdom in battle. She guided heroes such as Odysseus during his journey home in the Odyssey and Perseus in his quest to slay Medusa. She also played a major role in the Trojan War, siding with the Greeks after being insulted by Paris in the Judgment of Paris.</p>\n\n<p>One of her most well-known stories involves the founding of Athens. She competed against Poseidon to become the patron deity of the city. Poseidon struck the ground with his trident, creating a saltwater spring, while Athena offered an olive tree, symbolizing peace and prosperity. The people of Athens chose Athena's gift, and the city was named in her honor.</p>\n\n<p>Despite being a warrior goddess, Athena was also associated with wisdom, justice, and civilization. She was a virgin goddess who upheld the principles of rational thought and strategic warfare, distinguishing her from other deities of battle. Her influence extended beyond mythology, as she was revered in temples and statues throughout ancient Greece, most notably in the Parthenon, the grand temple dedicated to her in Athens.</p>",
