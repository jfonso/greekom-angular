  "introduction": "Tartarus is the deepest and most feared part of the Greek underworld, a dark abyss used as both a primordial entity and a place of punishment. Initially, it was where the Titans were imprisoned after their defeat by the Olympians, but later myths expanded its role as a prison for the wicked, where divine justice was carried out.",
  "mythicHistory": "<p>In early Greek cosmology, Tartarus was one of the first primordial entities to emerge, alongside Chaos, Gaia, and Eros. It was described as lying beneath Hades, as far below the earth as the earth is from the sky, making it the most remote and inaccessible place in existence.</p>\n\n<p>After the Titanomachy, Zeus cast the defeated Titans into Tartarus, imprisoning them behind great bronze gates guarded by monstrous beings like the Hecatoncheires. Over time, Tartarus became a place of divine punishment, where great sinners, such as Tantalus and Sisyphus, suffered eternal torment for their crimes against the gods.</p>\n\n<p>Later philosophical and Orphic traditions reinforced the idea of Tartarus as a realm of moral retribution, where those who defied divine law met their fate. It contrasted with Elysium, the paradise of the blessed, emphasizing the Greek belief in cosmic justice and order.</p>",
